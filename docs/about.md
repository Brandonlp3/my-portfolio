# About Me

I'm **Brandon Parker** — BSCS (AI + HCI) and incoming MSCS (Machine Learning) student at Georgia Tech. I work where **cloud infrastructure**, **full‑stack product engineering**, and **applied ML** meet human-centered design.

## Focus Areas
| Area | What I do |
|------|-----------|
| Cloud & Networking | Improve reliability, latency, and secure delivery paths |
| Full‑Stack Systems | Build APIs + frontends that emphasize clarity & iteration speed |
| Applied ML / NLP | Use models to summarize, prioritize, or augment—not overwhelm |
| Developer Experience | Reduce friction via tooling, docs, and observability |
| Assistive & Ethical Tech | Leverage software to broaden access and support users |

## Core Principles
1. Ship iteratively—optimize feedback loops early.
2. Make performance & reliability observable by design.
3. Simplicity scales; abstractions must earn their keep.
4. AI augments workflows when context is preserved.
5. Documentation should explain intent, not just behavior.

## Recent Milestones
- Launched sustainability Chrome extension (150+ users)
- Built ML/NLP experimentation projects (semantic parsing & summarization)
- Verizon internship: internal platform + automation reducing manual review time 60%+
- UKG internship: hybrid cloud networking exposure (edge, security, routing)

## Outside the Terminal
I enjoy reverse‑engineering product UX flows, sketching interface concepts, and mentoring peers on readable API design.
